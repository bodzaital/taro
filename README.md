Current version: `Alpha - v0.2.1`

A small photography culling and tagging app built with Bootstrap and Electron

So far only tested on macOS, but will eventually test on Windows and Linux.

How to run:
- install dependencies with `npm i`
- start with `npm start`
- be amazed at the stupidity of the code (but hey, it works)
