# taro
A small photography culling and tagging app built with Bootstrap and Electron

So far only tested on macOS, but will eventually test on Windows and Linux.

## Goals

- [ ] Open a folder of images.
- [ ] Assign tags, rating, description, title, location, etc. to images.
- [ ] Search for images by these metadata.
- [ ] Store this metadata in one JSON file per folder next to the images.
- [ ] "Export" images by criteria (copy every image above 4/5 rating to a new folder, etc).
